# What are the benefits of using the WordPress Starter Theme?

- The Starter Theme lets you use a visual approach to designing and coding WordPress themes through the power of Pinegrow’s tools for visually editing HTML and CSS.
- The Starter Theme uses template parts (a WordPress recommended best practice).
- The most common templates from the WordPress template hierarchy are immediately available as well as basic templates for the most popular e-commerce plugins: WooCommerce.
